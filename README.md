# potassium-js
#### A few Banano utilities for myself.

Using bananojs and a few RPC calls, this library can be used to interact effectively and efficiently with the Banano blockchain.

It's designed very specifically to cater the needs of my Banano-related projects e.g. PlayBanano / BananoPlanet / BanRX however if you can find a way to integrate it into your projects go ahead.


## Import

    npm i potassium-js

    let kjs = require("potassium-js");
    kjs.config({
      "node-rpc-url": "http://node.bananoplanet.cc:7072",
      "work-server-url": "https://mynano.ninja/api/node",
      "rep-account": "ban_3p1anetee7arfx9zbmspwf9c8c5r88wy6zkgwcbt7rndtcqsoj6fzuy11na3"
    });


## Contribute
If you want to contribute, send in a PR, but please don't get offended if I deny, since this repo was made with the sole intention to have a decent form of version control for a js file which I've been copy-pasting between repositories.


## Contact me
If you want to get in touch, whether that be for some usage advice or if you want to scream at me for structuring something heavily inefficiently, contact me on Discord (Shay#5787). You can find me in the [official Banano Discord server](https://chat.banano.cc/) in \#frankinsteins-lab and I'm sure there'll be plenty of other developers willing to help you out there as well.
